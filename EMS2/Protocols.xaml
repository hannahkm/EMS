This evidence-based protocol is designed to properly identify those patients who may benefit from prolonged resuscitation and transport to a hospital-based emergency department, as opposed to those patients whose resuscitations can be reliably and appropriately terminated in the prehospital environment.&#x0a;
2. CONTRAINDICATIONS TO PREHOSPITAL TERMINATION OF RESUSCITATION&#x0a;
    a) If arrest is believed to be secondary to hypothermia or submersion, treat according to appropriate protocol and transport to the nearest appropriate facility.&#x0a;
    b) If patient is pregnant, treat according to appropriate protocol and transport to the nearest appropriate facility.&#x0a;
    c) If patient has not reached their 18th birthday, treat according to appropriate protocol and transport to the nearest appropriate facility.&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] IF PATIENT HAS NOT REACHED THEIR 18TH BIRTHDAY, TERMINATION OF RESUSCITATION MAY BE CONSIDERED IN RARE CIRCUMSTANCES. CONTACT A PEDIATRIC BASE STATION (AT JOHNS HOPKINS CHILDREN’S CENTER OR CHILDREN’S NATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER) FOR ONLINE MEDICAL DIRECTION PRIOR TO TERMINATION. IF ONLINE CONSULTATION WITH A PEDIATRIC BASE STATION IS NOT POSSIBLE, TREAT ACCORDING TO APPROPRIATE PROTOCOL.&#x0a;&#x0a;
3. PROCEDURE&#x0a;
    a) Resuscitations started by bystanders prior to EMS arrival (traumatic or nontraumatic etiology):&#x0a;
        (1) EMS providers should terminate resuscitation if the patient meets the criteria listed in the Pronouncement of Death in the Field Protocol (section 2. Indications (a. – f.))&#x0a;
    b) BLS providers may terminate resuscitation if:&#x0a;
        (1) ALS resources are genuinely unavailable, and&#x0a;
        (2) The patient has received a minimum of 15 two-minute cycles of high quality CPR, and&#x0a;
        (3) During the five AED analyses immediately prior to TOR there was “no shock advised”&#x0a;
    c) Cardiac arrest (non-traumatic etiology)&#x0a;
        (1) EMS providers may terminate resuscitation&#x0a;
            (a) After the patient has received 15 two-minute cycles of CPR, the patients is:&#x0a;
                (i) in asystole, OR&#x0a;
                (ii) in VF, pulseless VT, or PEA with an EtCO2 of less than 15 mmHg&#x0a;
            (b) If patient does not meet TOR criteria, continue resuscitation and reevaluate at the next rhythm check&#x0a;
    d) Cardiac arrest (traumatic etiology)&#x0a;
        (2) EMS providers may terminate resuscitation regardless of total resuscitation time if:&#x0a;
            (a) The patient presents in asystole OR&#x0a;
            (b) The patient’s cardiac rhythm changes to asystole during the resuscitation&#x0a;
        (3) EMS providers may terminate resuscitation following five two-minute cycles of CPR according to the Trauma Protocol: Trauma Arrest Protocol for a patient who remains in PEA or VF&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] ASYSTOLE AND RESUSCITATIONS LASTING LONGER THAN 10 MINUTES ARE INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS OF MORTALITY IN THE TRAUMA PATIENT. TREATMENT OF THE TRAUMA ARREST PATIENT SHOULD FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING AND TREATING REVERSIBLE CAUSES DURING THAT NARROW RESUSCITATIVE WINDOW. TOR AND TRANSPORT DECISIONS SHOULD ONLY BE MADE AFTER ADMINISTERING TIME-SENSITIVE AND APPROPRIATE THERAPIES.&#x0a;&#x0a;

                    <Label Text="1. PURPOSE&#x0a;&#x0a;
This protocol is designed to guide the EMS provider in pronouncing death in the field.&#x0a;
Health General Article §5-202 provides that:&#x0a;
    a) An individual is dead if, based on ordinary standards of medical practice, the individual has sustained either:&#x0a;
        (1) Irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions; or&#x0a;
        (2) Irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem.&#x0a;&#x0a;
2. INDICATIONS&#x0a;&#x0a;
EMS providers may pronounce the death of a patient when one or more of the following criteria has been met.&#x0a;
    a) Decapitation&#x0a;
    b) Rigor mortis&#x0a;
    c) Decomposition&#x0a;
    d) Dependent lividity&#x0a;
    e) Pulseless, apneic patient in a multi-casualty incident where system resources are required for the stabilization of living patients&#x0a;
    f) Pulseless, apneic patient with an injury not compatible with life (with the exception of an obviously pregnant female where resuscitation attempts should be initiated and the patient transported to the nearest appropriate facility)&#x0a;
    g) The EMS provider has terminated resuscitation per the Termination of Resuscitation Protocol.&#x0a;&#x0a;
3. PROCEDURE&#x0a;&#x0a;
    a) Confirm that the patient is unresponsive, pulseless, and apneic.&#x0a;
    b) The patient who meets criteria in 2.e may be “black” tagged during triage (by a BLS or ALS provider), but asystole must be confirmed by ALS provider before a formal pronouncement of death.&#x0a;
    c) The patient who meets criteria in 2.f must be confirmed to be in asystole by ALS provider before a formal pronouncement of death. If the condition of the remains precludes obtaining a cardiac rhythm to confirm asystole (e.g., incineration, severe disruption of the torso, etc.), this must be documented on the patient care report.&#x0a;
    d) Document the exact time and location of the pronouncement of death.&#x0a;
    e) Notify law enforcement and follow local jurisdictional policies. If deceased patient is a tissue/organ donor and law enforcement has released the body to the family, please assist the family in calling either 800-923-1133 or (for Charles, Montgomery and Prince George’s counties) 703-641-0100. If death is pronounced during transport, deliver patient to the hospital and follow hospital policies.&#x0a;" Style="{StaticResource info}"></Label>

AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2011, THE MARYLAND MOLST FORM CAN BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF THE MARYLAND EMS/DNR FORM.&#x0a;&#x0a;
1. PREFACE EMS/DNR Order or MOLST forms, bracelets, and necklaces will recognize three patient options for care prior to arrest:
    a) Option A (ALS) (MOLST A1)—Maximal (Restorative) Care (with intubation) Before Arrest, then DNR&#x0a;
    b) Option A (DNI) (MOLST A2)—Comprehensive Efforts to Prevent Arrest But Do Not Intubate, then DNR&#x0a;
    c) Option B (BLS) (MOLST B)—Limited (Palliative) Care Only Before Arrest, then DNR&#x0a;
2. VALID EMS/DNR or MOLST BRACELET WITH INSERT or AUTHORIZED METAL EMBLEM HAS THE SAME EFFECT AS THE FORM.&#x0a;
    a) Typically only one EMS/DNR device is needed to initiate the EMS/DNR Protocol.&#x0a;
    b) EMS providers should only request a second instrument (e.g., a bracelet when a form has already been presented) if there is reason to question the validity of the first produced notification device.&#x0a;
3. RECIPROCITY&#x0a;
    a) A standardized EMS/DNR Order from another state may be honored.&#x0a;
    b) Out-of-state EMS/DNR Orders shall be followed to the full extent that is permissible by the Maryland Medical Protocols for Emergency Medical Services Providers. If there is misunderstanding with family members or others present at the scene or if there are other concerns about following the out of state EMS/DNR Order, contact online medical direction for assistance.&#x0a;
4. ORAL EMS/DNR ORDERS&#x0a;
    a) EMS providers may follow an oral EMS/DNR Order directly from a Marylandlicensed physician (MD or DO), physician assistant, or nurse practitioner who is physically present “on-site.” EMS shall not accept orders from private physician attendings, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner by telephone.&#x0a;
    b) EMS providers may follow an oral EMS/DNR Order from a Marylandlicensed physician “on-line” via the EMS Communications System (e.g., radio or telephone consult that is routed through a public service access point (PSAP) for audio recording).&#x0a;
5. ACCEPTABLE AND UNACCEPTABLE EMS/DNR ORDERS&#x0a;
    a) The following are acceptable for implementing the EMS/DNR Protocol:&#x0a;
        (1) Original Maryland EMS/DNR Order Form&#x0a;
        (2) Copy of the Maryland EMS/DNR Order Form (including an electronic copy on a computer or device for patient care decisions. The sending facility is required to provide a copy of the EMS/DNR Order or MOLST to the transport crew (listed in the instructions of the MOLST form and COMAR 10.01.21.03)).&#x0a;
        (3) Other State EMS/DNR Order Form&#x0a;
        (4) Maryland EMS/DNR Bracelet Insert&#x0a;
        (5) Medic Alert DNR Bracelet or Necklace&#x0a;
        (6) Oral DNR Order from EMS System Medical Consultation&#x0a;
        (7) Oral DNR Order from other on-site physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner&#x0a;
        (8) Maryland MOLST Form&#x0a;
        (9) Maryland MOLST Bracelet&#x0a;
    b) The following are not acceptable for implementing the EMS/DNR Protocol:&#x0a;
        (1) Advance directives without an EMS/DNR Order&#x0a;
        (2) Facility-specific DNR orders&#x0a;
        (3) Notes in medical records&#x0a;
        (4) Prescription pad orders&#x0a;
        (5) DNR stickers&#x0a;
        (6) An oral request from someone other than a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner&#x0a;
        (7) An oral order from an attending physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner who is not on site&#x0a;
        (8) Any other device or instrument not listed above as acceptable&#x0a;
6. VALIDITY OF EARLIER VERSIONS OF EMS/DNR ORDERS
    a) Older versions of EMS/DNR Orders — i.e., initial version (1995 and first revision, 4/1/96) — continue to be valid and need not be updated unless the patient or authorized decision maker wishes to take advantage of new features available in the newer forms.&#x0a;
    b) EMS providers should treat older versions of EMS/DNR order (pre 7/1/98) as “Option B (BLS) - Limited (Palliative) Care Only Before Arrest, Then DNR.”&#x0a;
7. REVOCATION OF AN EMS/DNR ORDER&#x0a;
    a) An EMS/DNR Order may be revoked at any time by:&#x0a;
        (1) Physical cancellation or destruction of all EMS/DNR Order devices; or&#x0a;
        (2) An oral statement by the patient made directly to emergency medical services personnel requesting only palliative care or resuscitation. If the patient revokes an EMS/DNR order orally, the EMS/DNR Order notification devices do not need to be destroyed. EMS providers should thoroughly document the circumstances of the revocation. An oral revocation by a patient is only good for the single response or transport for which it was issued.&#x0a;
    b) An authorized decision-maker, other than the patient, cannot revoke an EMS/ DNR Order orally. Because of the difficulty in identifying authorized decisionmakers in emergent situations, it is incumbent upon an authorized decisionmaker who has authority to revoke an EMS/DNR Order to either void or withhold all EMS/DNR Order devices if they wish resuscitation for the patient. If there is any confusion, the EMS provider should contact a Base Station for medical consult.&#x0a;
    c) Section 5-610 of the Health Care Decision Act (Health General Article, Annotated Code of Maryland) makes willful concealment, cancellation, defacement, obliteration, or damage of an advance directive (including EMS/DNR Orders), without the patient’s or authorized decision maker’s consent, a misdemeanor subject to a fine not exceeding $10,000, imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.&#x0a;
8. ANTICIPATED LOCATIONS FOR EMS/DNR ORDER FORMS:&#x0a;
EMS personnel shall be directed to look for an EMS/DNR Order in the following places:&#x0a;
    a) About a patient’s wrist, hung from a necklace, or safety-pinned to a patient’s clothing.&#x0a;
    b) At medical facilities, in the patient’s chart.&#x0a;
    c) In residences and domicile facilities, by the bedside, behind the patient’s bedroom door, or on the refrigerator door.&#x0a;
    d) In schools and educational institutions, in the nurse’s office, health room, or with the student’s attendant caregiver/aide.&#x0a;
    e) Family or caregivers will be expected to retrieve the original EMS/DNR Order prior to the ambulance’s arrival.&#x0a;
9. IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENT&#x0a;
    a) If the patient is able, the patient can self-identify during the initial assessment.&#x0a;
    b) If the patient is unable to communicate, then family, caregivers, or bystanders can identify the patient for EMS providers.&#x0a;
    c) If an EMS/DNR vinyl bracelet with insert or metal emblem (bracelet or necklace) is attached to a patient (on wrist, pendant from neck, pinned to clothing, etc.) the patient’s identity can be reasonably assumed by EMS providers.&#x0a;
    d) If an EMS/DNR vinyl bracelet insert or metal emblem (bracelet or necklace) is found detached from the patient, EMS personnel must treat it as an EMS/DNR Order form and identify the subject of the EMS/DNR Order as the patient. A valid bracelet insert alone, without the vinyl bracelet, is a valid EMS/ DNR Order so long as EMS providers confirm the patient’s identity.&#x0a;
    e) If EMS personnel are unable to ascertain with reasonable certainty, when required to do so, that the subject of the EMS/DNR Order is the patient, they may resuscitate the patient.&#x0a;
10. HEALTH PROVIDER/EMS PERSONNEL IMMUNITY&#x0a;
    a) General immunity provisions, such as Good Samaritan immunity for volunteers and sovereign immunity for government employees, may apply under specific circumstances.&#x0a;
    b) In addition to other immunity that may be provided for in law, the Health Care Decisions Act provides the following specific immunity in cases involving the provision, withdrawal, or withholding of care that may be life-sustaining in nature:&#x0a;
(1) EMS providers are not subject to criminal prosecution or civil liability or deemed to have engaged in unprofessional conduct as determined by the appropriate licensing, registering, or certifying authority as a result of withholding or withdrawing any health care under authorization obtained in accordance with the Health Care Decisions Act. See HG (5-609(a)(1)).&#x0a;
(2) EMS providers providing, withholding, or withdrawing treatment under authorization obtained under the Health Care Decisions Act do not incur liability arising out of any claim to the extent the claim is based on lack of consent or authorization for the action. See HG (5-609(a)(2)).&#x0a;
(3) EMS providers providing treatment because they reasonably believe that an EMS/DNR order, other than a bracelet, is not valid, do not incur liability arising out of any claim to the extent the claim is based on lack of consent or authorization for the action. See HG (5-608(d)).&#x0a;
11. EMS/DNR MEDICAL PROTOCOLS&#x0a;
    a) DISPATCH&#x0a;
        (1) Option B EMS/DNR patients (7/98 version) or patients with older version EMS/DNR orders only require a BLS response. Once the on-scene BLS provider has determined the need for additional pain control, an ALS Rendezvous may be requested. Medevac requests are not appropriate for these patients.&#x0a;
        (2) Option A or A (DNI) EMS/DNR patients (7/98 version) who are not in arrest may require a range of responses from BLS through the highest echelon of response available. This will depend on the information available to dispatch and the service requested. The response complement in these cases will be dictated by local standard operating procedures (SOP).&#x0a;
        (3) If a dispatch center is unclear whether the DNR order is an EMS/DNR order or is unclear about the pre-arrest patient care option selected (A, A (DNI), or B), the dispatch center shall dispatch the appropriate resources based on the information available.&#x0a;
        (4) In the absence of knowledge to the contrary, information from medical professionals at a health care facility about the EMS/DNR status of a patient may be presumed to be reliable.&#x0a;
    b) PERFORM LIMITED PATIENT ASSESSMENT&#x0a;
        Vital signs:&#x0a;
        (1) Check for absence of a palpable pulse.&#x0a;
        (2) Check for absence of spontaneous respirations in an unresponsive patient.&#x0a;
        (3) Check for a valid EMS/DNR Order or MOLST form; vinyl bracelet insert worn either on the wrist, as a necklace, or pinned to clothing; or for a metal emblem (bracelet or necklace).&#x0a;
    c) RESUSCITATE/DO NOT RESUSCITATE CRITERIA&#x0a;
        (1) If an EMS/DNR Order is not present, revoked, or otherwise void, the EMSprovider shall treat and, if necessary, transport the patient.&#x0a;
        (2) If an EMS/DNR Order is not present, but the EMS provider believes that resuscitation or further resuscitation is futile, they may initiate the Termination of Resuscitation Protocol.&#x0a;
        (3) If a valid EMS/DNR order is found and the patient is in cardiac or respiratory arrest, no resuscitative measures shall be initiated.&#x0a;
        (4) If the patient is conscious and able to communicate that they revoke the EMS/DNR orally directly to EMS providers, EMS providers shall treat and, if necessary, transport the patient.&#x0a;
        (5) If the EMS/DNR patient (Option A, A (DNI), or B) arrests, withhold or withdraw further resuscitation and provide support to the family and caregivers. Consider notifying appropriate personnel.&#x0a;
    d) OPTION A (MOLST A1) – MAXIMAL (RESTORATIVE) CARE PROTOCOL&#x0a;
        (1) When Option A - “Maximal (Restorative) Care (with intubation) Before Arrest, then DNR” is selected on an EMS/DNR Order or MOLST form, the patient shall receive the full scope of restorative interventions permissible under the Maryland EMS Medical Protocols (including Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), cardiac monitoring, synchronized cardioversion for pulsepresent ventricular or supraventricular tachycardia, cardiac pacing for pulsepresent symptomatic bradycardia, insertion of IVs, and drug therapy), in an attempt to forestall cardiac or respiratory arrest.&#x0a;
        (2) This option was requested primarily by long-term care facilities for their patients who are on DNR orders for potentially prolonged periods of time. Many of these patients are less concerned about palliation of pain and more concerned about the quality of life after a stroke or heart attack. The primary medical conditions seen in the field necessitating this option have been the desire to administer dextrose for diabetic emergencies and epinephrine for anaphylactic reactions in patients who, upon arrest, are not to be resuscitated.&#x0a;
        (3) If, despite these efforts, the patient becomes pulseless or stops breathing spontaneously, EMS providers shall then withhold or withdraw cardiopulmonary resuscitation (including, but not limited to, CPR, cardiac pacing, defibrillation), withdrawal of active ventilatory assistance upon cardiac arrest, and withholding or withdrawal of drug therapy (e.g., chemical resuscitation).&#x0a;
    e) OPTION A (DNI) (MOLST A2) – COMPREHENSIVE EFFORTS TO PREVENT ARREST BUT DO NOT INTUBATE, THEN DNR&#x0a;
        (1) Option A (DNI) is exactly the same as Option A, which may include limited ventilatory support by CPAP or BiPAP, but Do Not Intubate.&#x0a;
        (2) Therefore, inappropriate care for “Option A (DNI) – Comprehensive Efforts to Prevent Arrest but Do Not Intubate, then DNR” would be nasal or oral intubation. &#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] IF MAXIMAL CARE IS SELECTED AND THE PATIENT’S CONDITION REQUIRES ALS, AN ALS UNIT SHOULD BE REQUESTED IF FEASIBLE GIVEN THE LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT RELATIVE TO THE NEAREST APPROPRIATE FACILITY, THE AVAILABILITY OF AN ALS UNIT, AND ITS ABILITY TO ARRIVE OR RENDEZVOUS IN A MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE PERIOD OF TIME.&#x0a;&#x0a;
    f) OPTION B (MOLST B)– PALLIATIVE CARE PROTOCOL &#x0a;
        (1) Supportive Care for Control of Signs and Symptoms&#x0a;
            (a) Respiratory distress&#x0a;
                (i) Open the airway using noninvasive means (e.g., chin lift, jaw thrust, finger sweep, nasopharyngeal airway, oropharyngeal airway, Heimlich maneuver, or laryngoscopy with Magill forceps for suspected airway obstruction, but no cricothyroidotomy and no tracheostomy).&#x0a;
                (ii) Administer O2 as follows:&#x0a;
                    a. If the patient is not on a ventilator and would benefit from oxygen therapy, provide passive oxygen via nasal cannula or nonrebreather mask (but no positive pressure oxygen via ambu bag, demand valve, or ventilator). If available, pulse oximetry and waveform capnography may be used.&#x0a;
                    b. If the patient is found on an outpatient ventilator and is not in cardiac arrest, maintain ventilatory support during transport to the hospital.&#x0a;
                    c. If the patient is found on an outpatient ventilator and is in cardiac arrest, contact on-line medical direction to consult about disconnecting the ventilator.&#x0a;
                (iii) Maintain an open airway by noninvasive means (e.g., chin lift, jaw thrust, finger sweep, nasopharyngeal airway, oropharyngeal airway, and Heimlich maneuver or laryngoscopy with Magill forceps for suspected airway obstruction, but no cricothyroidotomy and no tracheostomy).&#x0a;
                (iv) Suction as necessary.&#x0a;
                (v) Position for comfort.&#x0a;
            (b) External bleeding&#x0a;
                (i) Standard treatment (direct pressure with dressing, tourniquet)&#x0a;
                (ii) No IVs&#x0a;
            (c) Immobilize fractures using skills and devices that minimize pain.&#x0a;
            (d) Uncontrolled pain or other symptoms (e.g., severe nausea)&#x0a;
                (i) Allow patient, family, or health care providers (other than the prehospital provider) to administer patient’s prescribed medications. Such health care providers administering medication will not have to accompany the patient to the hospital. Any medications administered by the patient, family or healthcare providers must be documented in the patient care report (PCR).&#x0a;
                (ii) Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) systems for pain medication delivery and other patient-controlled medication (PCM) systems shall be left in place in DNR patients and monitored to the extent possible according to the provider’s level of certification or licensure.&#x0a;
                (iii) For the patient with significant pain and/or pain with a prolonged transport, the pain management protocol may be initiated.&#x0a;
            (e) Existing IV lines may be in place and shall be monitored to the extent possible according to the provider’s level of certification and licensure.&#x0a;
        (2) Inappropriate Care for a Palliative Care Patient&#x0a;
            (a) Cardiac monitoring, including 12-lead EKG, pacing, cardioversion, and defibrillation&#x0a;
            (b) Initiation of IV therapy (except for medications listed in the pain management protocol administration for pain control as in 1 (d) (iii))
            (c) EMS-initiated medications (except oxygen, and medications listed in the pain management protocol as in 1 (d) (iii))&#x0a;
            (d) CPR&#x0a;
            (e) Intubation (alternative airway device, endotracheal, nasotracheal, or gastric tube)&#x0a;
            (f) Active ventilatory assistance, unless on an outpatient ventilator&#x0a;
    (g) TRANSPORT&#x0a;
        (1) Upon request of the patient, family, or caregivers and in lieu of transport to a hospital-based emergency department, EMS providers may transport Option B EMS/DNR patients who require transportation for pain control or symptom management or respite care to a specified inpatient hospice facility.&#x0a;
        (2) A current list of those facilities is available from the MIEMSS Program Development Office 410-706-4367 (4DNR). The receiving status of a particular facility can be ascertained from EMRC (24 hours a day) by EMS radio, EMSTEL, or red phone, or by calling 800-492-3805.&#x0a;
        (3) The State EMS Board may authorize additional facilities under 6.2.2 or 6.2.4 (pp. 35 -36), if recognized in the future by DHMH in accordance with 42 CFR 418.98 and 42 CFR 418.100. EMS jurisdictions and commercial ambulance services will be notified by MIEMSS of any facilities that become eligible and elect to receive patients by ambulance, become ineligible, or elect to discontinue their participation.&#x0a;
        (4) Take a copy of EMS/DNR Order or MOLST form, vinyl bracelet with insert, or metal emblem (bracelet or necklace) to the hospital with the patient. If returning the patient from a previous transport, be sure to request a copy of the EMS/DNR Order form, vinyl bracelet with insert, or metal emblem (bracelet or necklace) from the staff. The sending facility is required to provide a copy of the EMS/DNR Order or MOLST to the transport crew (listed in the instructions of the MOLST form and COMAR 10.01.21.03).&#x0a;
    h) COMMUNICATIONS&#x0a;
        (1) Consultation requirements for Option A EMS/DNR patients shall be dictated by the Maryland EMS Medical Protocols in accordance with the patient’s medical needs. EMS providers shall notify the hospital of the patient’s EMS/ DNR status (i.e., Option A) and the identity of patient’s physician or nurse practitioner.&#x0a;
        (2) No consultation is required for the Option B EMS/DNR patients. The receiving hospital or inpatient hospice facility should be notified to expect the patient and prepare accordingly. Also make the hospital or inpatient facility aware of the patient’s EMS/DNR status (i.e., Option B) and the identity of the patient’s physician or nurse practitioner.&#x0a;
        (3) If there is misunderstanding with family members or others present at the scene or if there are other concerns about following the EMS/DNR Order and the patient’s condition permits, contact the physician or nurse practitioner signing the order, or the patient’s hospice program, or on-line medical direction for assistance.&#x0a;
    i) DOCUMENTATION&#x0a;
        (1) If possible, make or retain a copy of the EMS/DNR Order or MOLST form and attach it to the official copy of the patient care report that is kept by the EMS service. Having a copy of the EMS/DNR Order or MOLST form can significantly reduce documentation requirements. Encourage sending facilities to provide you with an additional copy of the EMS/DNR order or MOLST form with the patient’s transfer documents.&#x0a;
        (2) If the EMS/DNR Protocol is initiated: &#x0a;
            (a) Document, in the narrative section:&#x0a;
                (i) Who gave you the EMS/DNR Order or MOLST form (as an applicable person physically providing the written order, name of on-site physician or nurse practitioner, or name of on-line medical direction physician) or&#x0a;
                (ii) Where the EMS/DNR Order or MOLST form was found;&#x0a;
            (b) Document the EMS/DNR order number, the effective date of the order, the name of the patient, the patient’s date of birth, and the name of the physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant who signed the order;&#x0a;
            (c) Document the time the EMS/DNR Protocol was initiated;&#x0a;
            (d) Document any care rendered;&#x0a;

2. Presentation&#x0a;&#x0a;
An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a device that delivers an internal defibrillation (shock) whenever the patient’s heart rhythm/rate exceeds defined limits. EMS providers may encounter ICD devices that are appropriately or inappropriately delivering shock therapy. Internal shocks cause patient discomfort but DO NOT pose a danger to EMS personnel even when in direct contact with patient receiving an internal shock.&#x0a;
3. Treatment&#x0a;
    a) Place patient in position of comfort.&#x0a;
    b) Assess and treat for shock if indicated.&#x0a;
    c) Continuously monitor airway and reassess vitals every 5 minutes.&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] IF PATIENT IS IN CARDIAC ARREST, PERFORM CPR AND USE AED AS APPROPRIATE DESPITE THE PATIENT’S ICD, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE DELIVERING SHOCKS.&#x0a;&#x0a;
    d) Establish IV access with LR.&#x0a;
    e) Monitor cardiac rhythm and treat according to appropriate algorithm(s).&#x0a;
    f) ICD deactivation: Patient must meet the following criteria:&#x0a;
        (1) Three or more distinct shocks and&#x0a;
        (2) Obvious device malfunction with an EMS provider-witnessed inappropriate shock (e.g., alert patient in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate or SVT)&#x0a;
    g) Place an EMS donut magnet directly over device. Magnet placed directly over will deactivate device and shocks will not be delivered. After defibrillator is deactivated, tape magnet firmly in place and treat according to the appropriate algorithm(s).&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] IF THE PATIENT HAS A COMBINATION ICD AND PACEMAKER, DEACTIVATING THE ICD MAY OR MAY NOT DEACTIVATE THE PACEMAKER.&#x0a;
    h) Regardless of the decision to deactivate the ICD device, be prepared to manage the underlying rhythm (e.g., treat wide complex tachycardia with cardioversion or amiodarone per protocol as appropriate).&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] IF PATIENT BECOMES UNSTABLE OR IN THE EVENT OF A RHYTHM CHANGE WHERE A SHOCK IS DESIRED, REMOVE THE MAGNET TO REACTIVATE THE ICD. IF REACTIVATION DOES NOT OCCUR, USE MANUAL DEFIBRILLATOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH TACHYCARDIA PROTOCOL. CONTINUE CHEST COMPRESSIONS FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WHO REMAIN POORLY PERFUSED DESPITE PACEMAKER CAPTURE.&#x0a;&#x0a;
    i) If ICD deactivation indications are questionable or deactivation is unsuccessful (or a donut magnet is not available) and undesired shocks continue, medications may be administered for patient comfort.&#x0a;
        (1) Administer opioid per Pain Management Protocol. OR&#x0a;
        (2) Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg SLOW IVP/IN/IM/IO. Maximum single dose is 5 mg. (Paramedic may perform without consult.)&#x0a;

Inclusion Criteria:&#x0a;
Patient presents with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) symptoms and has one of the following in a diagnostic quality EKG:&#x0a;
    a) Greater than 1 mm of ST elevation in two or more contiguous limb leads&#x0a;
    b) Greater than 1.5 mm of ST elevation in two or more precordial leads (in women)&#x0a;
    c) Greater than 2 mm of ST elevation in two or more precordial leads (in men)&#x0a;
    d) Anterior, Inferior, or Lateral MI: ST elevation greater than 1 mm in two or more contiguous leads and QRS complex is narrower than 0.12 seconds; (if wider than 0.12, you are unable to diagnose as STEMI) OR&#x0a;
    e) Posterior MI: ST depression greater than 1 mm in V1 and V2 with an R/S ratio of greater than or equal to one and QRS complex is narrower than 0.12 seconds; (if wider than 0.12, you are unable to diagnose as STEMI)&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT]IF PATIENT MEETS ABOVE STEMI CRITERIA, THIS PATIENT IS A PRIORITY 1 PATIENT AND REQUIRES NOTIFICATION OF THE NEAREST DESIGNATED CARDIAC INTERVENTIONAL CENTER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO ALLOW FOR HOSPITAL PREPARATION. DURING THE CONSULTATION WITH THE RECEIVING FACILITY, THE PROVIDER SHALL USE THE VERBIAGE, “STEMI ALERT” AS THE UNIVERSAL METHOD OF NOTIFYING THE FACILITY THAT THE PATIENT MEETS THE STEMI INCLUSION CRITERIA.&#x0a;&#x0a;
DETECTION OF RIGHT VENTRICULAR AND POSTERIOR WALL INFARCTION IS IMPORTANT, AS APPROXIMATELY 40% OF PATIENTS WITH INFERIOR WALL INFARCTIONS HAVE RIGHT VENTRICULAR AND/OR POSTERIOR WALL INVOLVEMENT, WHICH PREDISPOSES THEM TO MORE COMPLICATIONS AND INCREASED MORTALITY.&#x0a;&#x0a;
Consider the following presentations as indicative of increased cardiovascular risk and request guidance from the closest appropriate EMS Base Station or Cardiac lnterventional Center.&#x0a;
    a) Left bundle branch block (LBBB): LBBB is rare in the setting of acute myocardial infarction and often indicates underlying cardiovascular disease. LBBB is more likely to signal a myocardial infarction if one of the following conditions are met:&#x0a;
        1) Patient presents in cardiogenic shock&#x0a;
        2) EKG shows excessive ST segment elevation greater than 5 mm&#x0a;
        3) EKG shows ST segment deviation (elevation or depression) in the same direction as the QRS complex. This concept is known as inappropriate concordance.&#x0a;
    b) Wellens’ Wave: Biphasic T waves or deeply inverted T waves in precordial leads (V2-V3, +/-V4).&#x0a;
    c) ST segment elevation in Lead aVR: Multilead ST segment depression with coexisting ST segment elevation in lead aVR.&#x0a;
    d) Hyperacute T waves: Peaked, broad-based T waves&#x0a;
3. Treatment&#x0a;
    a) Follow Chest Pain Protocol for nitrate, aspirin, and pain management.&#x0a;
    b) If patient meets above STEMI criteria, this patient is a Priority 1 patient and requires a medical consult.&#x0a;
    c) If a patient meets one of the above condition sets for STEMI inclusion criteria, the patient shall be transported to the closest Cardiac Interventional Center by air or ground as long as the delivery time is not more than 45 minutes greater than transport to the nearest ED.&#x0a;
        (1) When indicated and based on the EMS provider’s report, the Base Station physician at the receiving Cardiac Interventional Center will activate its Cardiac Interventional Team.&#x0a;
        (2) The receiving ED physician will determine if the patient can bypass the ED and go directly to the cardiac catheterization lab to meet the cardiac interventional team.&#x0a;
        (3) If the patient cannot be delivered to a Cardiac Interventional Center within the allotted time, complete the Fibrinolytic Therapy Checklist for STEMI.&#x0a;
            (a) If the patient meets all of the criteria for fibrinolytic therapy, transport to the nearest ED.&#x0a;
            (b) If the patient does not meet all of the criteria for fibrinolytic therapy, consult with the nearest Cardiac Interventional Center and the nearest ED to determine the most appropriate receiving facility.&#x0a;
    d) If patient does not have EKG ST elevations greater than 1 mm in two contiguous leads, the patient shall be transported to the closest appropriate facility.&#x0a;
    e) If a patient presents with IWMI, obtain a tracing of V4R to rule out right ventricular involvement. If ST elevation noted in V4R, withhold nitrates. The triad of RVMI often includes clear lung sounds, hypotension, and JVD. 40% of IWMI have right ventricular involvement. If hypotensive with clear lung sounds, administer 250–500 mL of LR.&#x0a;
For additional bolus, perform medical consultation.&#x0a;&#x0a;
CONSULT A PEDIATRIC BASE STATION FOR CHILDREN WITH ST ELEVATIONS WHO HAVE NOT REACHED THEIR 18TH BIRTHDAY.&#x0a;&#x0a;
Fibrinolytic Therapy Checklist for STEMI&#x0a;
Use this checklist if a STEMI patient cannot be delivered to a Cardiac Interventional Center within 45 minutes greater than transport to the nearest ED. All of the “YES” boxes and all of the “NO” boxes must be checked before a patient should be transported to the nearest emergency department.&#x0a;&#x0a;
INCLUSION CRITERIA (All of these must be checked):&#x0a;&#x0a;

2. Presentation&#x0a;&#x0a;
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas that is most commonly a product of incomplete combustion. Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs when a victim is exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide, frequently seen in house fires, malfunctioning furnaces, with suicide attempts, or others. Presentation may vary depending on the concentration, method, and duration of exposure to the agent. Symptoms may include but are not limited to: headache, dizziness, and nausea and vomiting, most frequently. Symptoms can also include: chest pain, altered mental status, dyspnea, and/or seizures&#x0a;&#x0a;

a) Excited delirium syndrome (ExDS) is a potentially life-threatening condition in which a person is in a psychotic and extremely agitated state. Mentally, the subject is unable to process rational thoughts or to focus their attention. Physically, the body’s systems are functioning at such a high rate that they begin to shut down and fail. When these two factors occur at the same time, a person can act erratically enough that they become a danger to self and to the public.&#x0a;
b) History of present illness often includes:&#x0a;
    (1) Ingestion of a stimulant or hallucinogenic drug&#x0a;
    (2) Drug/alcohol withdrawal&#x0a;
    (3) Psychiatric patient who is off of medication&#x0a;
c) Signs and symptoms: ExDS is characterized as having a minimum of bizarre and aggressive behavior and one of the above history. The more signs and symptoms the patient exhibits, the more likely the patient is to have ExDS and the higher the risk for complications.&#x0a;
    (1) Tachycardia&#x0a;
    (2) Hypertension&#x0a;
    (3) High body temperature&#x0a;
    (4) Dilated pupil&#x0a;
    (5) Incoherent or nonsensical speech&#x0a;
    (6) Rapid or inconsistent breathing patterns&#x0a;
    (7) Paranoia&#x0a;
    (8) Skin changes:&#x0a;
        (a) Hot/dry skin (in the anticholinergic patient)&#x0a;
        (b) Profuse sweating (in the cocaine/MDMA/methamphetamine patient)&#x0a;
    (9) Shivering&#x0a;
    (10) Inappropriate removal of clothing&#x0a;
    (11) Patients who present after receiving multiple TASER or other less lethal energy by law enforcement&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] MANY LIFE-THREATENING MEDICAL EMERGENCIES PRESENT WITH SIMILAR SIGNS OF EXDS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE HYPOGLYCEMIA, HYPOXIA, SEIZURES, HEAD INJURIES, AND SEPSIS. EMS PROVIDERS MUST ALWAYS ASSESS FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF OTHER EMERGENCY MEDICAL CAUSES FOR THE PATIENT’S PRESENTATION.&#x0a;&#x0a;
ANOTHER KEY SYMPTOM THAT OCCURS JUST PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF SUDDEN DEATH IN A PATIENT EXPERIENCING EXDS IS “INSTANT TRANQUILITY.” THIS SYMPTOM IS NOTED WHEN A PATIENT WHO HAS BEEN VERY VIOLENT AND AGITATED SUDDENLY BECOMES QUIET AND LETHARGIC. THIS IS A SIGN OF IMMINENT CARDIOPULMONARY ARREST. PATIENTS WHO HAVE UNDERGONE PERIODS OF PROLONGED PHYSICAL STRUGGLE WITHOUT SEDATION WITH MEDICATION ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR CARDIAC ARREST. ALL EFFORTS MUST BE MADE BY ALS PROVIDERS TO EXPEDITIOUSLY ADMINISTER MEDICATION TO THE AGITATED AND STRUGGLING EXDS PATIENT.&#x0a;&#x0a;
3. Treatment (BLS)&#x0a;
    a) Ensure scene is secure and safe.&#x0a;
    b) Initiate patient care.&#x0a;
        (1) Obtain a measured temperature, as these patients often have severe hyperthermia.&#x0a;
        (2) If possible, attempt to identify the amount, route, and time of any substance ingested.&#x0a;
        (3) Suspected ExDS patients with evidence of head injury or traumatic mechanism of injury should receive Spinal Protection Protocol.&#x0a;
    c) Patients displaying signs of ExDS do not have medical capacity to refuse care.&#x0a;
        (1) If a suspected ExDS patient resists the delivery of care, ALS resources, EMS supervisors (where available), and law enforcement shall be requested to facilitate the treatment and transport of the patient in a safe and effective manner.&#x0a;
        (2) Patients who exhibit violent behavior shall require a police officer to accompany the patient during transport. Appropriate physical restraint procedures should be utilized per Restraint Protocol.&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] PATIENTS DISPLAYING SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF EXDS SHALL BE TREATED AND TRANSPORTED AT THE ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT LEVEL. ALS CARE AND TREATMENT WILL BE GUIDED BY THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS THAT THE PATIENT IS EXHIBITING, AS WELL AS POSSIBLE OCCULT INJURIES THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED WHILE THE INDIVIDUAL WAS BEING SUBDUED. THE APPROPRIATE LIFESAVING TREATMENT FOR EXDS IS THE ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICATION, FLUID RESUSCITATION, AND DECREASING HYPERTHERMIC CORE BODY TEMPERATURE.&#x0a;
PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF ENERGY FROM CONDUCTED ELECTRICAL WEAPONS (INCLUDING T.A.S.E.R.) AND ARE DISPLAYING SIGNS OF EXDS ARE AT HEIGHTENED RISK FOR SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH. THESE PATIENTS SHOULD BE TREATED WITH MEDICATION AND CLOSELY MONITORED FOR ANY EVIDENCE OF HEMODYNAMIC COLLAPSE.&#x0a;&#x0a;
    d) Establish IV/IO access. Consider blood draw if possible.&#x0a;
    e) Administer 20 mL/kg IV fluid bolus LR if tachycardiac and/or hyperthermic.&#x0a;
    f) Check glucometer and treat accordingly.&#x0a;
    g) Administer ketamine.&#x0a;
        (1) Administer 1 mg/kg IV/IO. Maximum single IV/IO dose 100 mg.&#x0a;
            (a) If severe agitation persists, administer 1 mg/kg IV/IO. Maximum single IV/ IO dose 100 mg. Maximum total IV/IO dose 200 mg.&#x0a;
            (b) If agitation persists after second dose of ketamine, consider midazolam 2.5 mg IV/IO.&#x0a;
        (2) If IV/IO unavailable:
            (a) Administer 4 mg/kg IM. Maximum total IM dose 400 mg.&#x0a;
            (b) If severe agitation persists after IM ketamine dose, administer midazolam 5 mg IM.&#x0a;
            (c) Additional dose of 4 mg/kg IM ketamine for persistent agitation requires medical consultation.&#x0a;
    h) Consider the administration of cold packs to the groin, neck, and axilla for patients displaying evidence of hyperthermia.&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] PATIENTS DISPLAYING SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF ExDS SHOULD NOT RECEIVE HALDOL AND/OR BENADRYL FOR CHEMICAL RESTRAINT. THESE MEDICATIONS MAY WORSEN AN ANTICHOLINERGIC CRISIS. HALDOL MAY INCREASE THE POSSIBILITY OF CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIA BY PROLONGING THE QT INTERVAL, AND MAY ALSO INCREASE THE CHANCES OF A SEIZURE BY LOWERING THE BODY’S SEIZURE THRESHOLD.&#x0a;&#x0a;

    k) Check glucometer and treat accordingly.&#x0a;
    l) Administer ketamine.&#x0a;
        (1) Patients who have not yet reached their 13th birthday require medical consultation: Administer 1 mg/kg IV/IO. Maximum single IV/IO dose 100 mg. Maximum total IV/IO dose 200 mg.&#x0a;
        (2) Patients aged 13 years to not yet reached their 18th birthday: Administer 1 mg/kg IV/IO. Maximum single IV/IO dose 100 mg. Maximum total dose 200 mg.&#x0a;
        (3) If severe agitation persists, administer repeat dose 1 mg/kg IV/IO to a maximum single dose of 100 mg.&#x0a;
        (4) If agitation persists after second dose of IV/IO ketamine, consider midazolam 0.1 mg/kg SLOW IVP/IO over 1–2 minutes. Maximum single dose 2.5 mg.&#x0a;
        (5) If IV/IO is unavailable:&#x0a;
        (a) Patients who have not yet reached their 13th birthday require medical consultation: Administer 4 mg/kg IM. Maximum IM dose 400 mg.&#x0a;
        (b) Patients aged 13 years to not yet reached their 18th birthday: Administer 4 mg/kg IM. Maximum IM dose 400 mg.&#x0a;
        (c) If severe agitation persists, administer midazolam 2.5 mg IM.&#x0a;
        (d) Additional dose of 4 mg/kg IM ketamine for persistent agitation requires medical consultation.&#x0a;

2. Presentation&#x0a;&#x0a;
Accurate diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF)/acute pulmonary edema (APE) as the cause of respiratory distress can be challenging. The most accurate identification of CHF/APE is made using the medical history, risk factors, medications, and physical exam with interpretation of blood pressure.&#x0a;
CHF/APE is difficult to distinguish, at times, from other respiratory causes. Factors most associated with a short-of-breath patient having CHF include: a history of CHF, exam features of jugular venous distension and EKG evidence of Atrial Fibrillation. CHF patients are commonly on anti-hypertensive and cardiac medicines. Orthopnea (use of additional pillows to prop the head up during sleep), Dyspnea on Exertion and Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnea (PND) are symptoms associated with CHF/APE. Blood pressure is frequently elevated, usually greater than 160/100 but not uncommonly greater than 180/120.&#x0a;
EMS providers should strongly consider CHF/APE in patients possessing the factors above, presenting with acute respiratory distress, tachypnea, hypoxia, rales, or wheezing and marked hypertension, even in the absence of peripheral edema.&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] GERIATRIC PATIENTS DEMONSTRATING MARKED HYPERTENSION IN ASSOCIATION WITH SHORTNESS OF BREATH/RESPIRATORY DISTRESS AND WHEEZING (IN THE ABSENCE OF ASTHMA OR INFECTION) STRONGLY SUGGESTS CHF/APE.&#x0a;&#x0a;
Acute Respiratory Distress from CHF may range from mild to severe, life-threatening cases of Acute Pulmonary Edema. This classification is for patients with Systolic BP greater than 110 mmHg.&#x0a;
    a) Asymptomatic – dyspnea on exertion but no symptoms at rest.&#x0a;
    b) Mild – mild dyspnea at rest, despite O2 treatment. Able to speak in full sentences.&#x0a;
    c) Moderate – moderate dyspnea. O2 saturation less than 93% on oxygen. Systolic BP usually greater than 150. Unable to speak in full sentences. Normal mental status.&#x0a;
    d) Severe – severe dyspnea, respiratory failure, hypoxia (O2 saturation less than 90% on oxygen), diaphoresis, Systolic BP commonly greater than 180. One word sentences, altered consciousness. The goals of treatment are to reduce the pressure of blood returning to the heart (preload) and the resistance that the left ventricle must pump against (afterload). The most effective and safe medication for these goals is nitroglycerin (NTG).&#x0a;
3. Treatment
    a) Position patient in high Fowler’s position.&#x0a;
    b) Rate the patient’s difficulty breathing on a scale where 0 is “no trouble breathing” and 10 is “the worst trouble breathing.”&#x0a;
    c) Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) should be considered for moderate dyspnea and must be implemented in severe dyspnea. (Use early; attempt to administer 3 doses of NTG while setting up, acclimatizing the patient, and applying CPAP.)&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] PERFORM 12-LEAD EKG (IF AVAILABLE), AND IF INFERIOR WALL WITH POSTERIOR WALL EXTENSION MI IS PRESENT, WITHOLD NTG. CONSULT FOR FURTHER ADMINISTRATION.&#x0a;&#x0a;
    d) Establish IV access with LR.&#x0a;
    e) Identify rhythm and treat according to appropriate algorithm.&#x0a;
    f) For patients with hypertension and moderate to severe symptoms, administer NTG (does not require IV before administration). If SBP drops below 90 mmHg, treat with medical fluid bolus: initial bolus 250–500 mL, may repeat once.&#x0a;
        (1) Asymptomatic - apply oxygen per GPC to maintain O2 saturation greater than 93%.&#x0a;
        (2) Mild - administer low dose NTG 0.4 mg SL at 3–5 minute intervals to a maximum dose of 1.2 mg.&#x0a;
        (3) Moderate and severe - CPAP is preferred therapy. Until CPAP is applied, administer high dose NTG. Assess BP before each administration.&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] CPAP IS THE PREFERRED THERAPY. DO NOT REMOVE CPAP TO CONTINUE ADMINISTERING NTG.&#x0a;&#x0a;
        High Dose NTG until CPAP is applied or if CPAP is not tolerated. (Dose at 3–5 minute intervals.)&#x0a;
        (4) Administer 1 dose of NTG 0.4 mg SL and apply 1 inch of NTG paste.&#x0a;
        (5) Administer 1 dose of NTG 0.8 mg SL.&#x0a;
        (6) Continue 0.8 mg SL NTG dosing to achieve a 20% reduction in SBP.&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] IF BLOOD PRESSURE IS LOW, CONSIDER MEDICAL FLUID BOLUS(ES) FOLLOWED BY DOPAMINE.&#x0a;&#x0a;
    g) Consider dopamine 2–20 mcg/kg/min. Titrate to SBP 100 mmHg or medical-consultation-directed BP. IV infusion pump preferred.&#x0a;
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - &#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] MEDICAL CONSULTATION IS REQUIRED IF THE PATIENT HAS CONGENITAL HEART OR CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE.&#x0a;&#x0a;
    h) Position patient in semi-Fowler’s position.&#x0a;
    i) Establish IV access with LR.&#x0a;
    j) Identify rhythm and treat according to appropriate algorithm.&#x0a;
    k) Patients with moderate to severe respiratory distress may require high flow oxygen via non-rebreather mask, CPAP, or BVM while receiving medication via nebulizer.&#x0a;
    l) Consider albuterol.&#x0a;
        For children less than 2 years, albuterol 1.25 mg&#x0a;
        For children greater than or equal to 2 years, albuterol 2.5 mg&#x0a;
    m) Consider morphine.&#x0a; 0.1 mg/kg SLOW IVP/IO/IM (1–2 mg/min) Maximum dose 5 mg&#x0a;
    n) Consider dopamine. 2–20 mcg/kg/min Titrate to pediatric medical consultation directed BP. IV infusion pump preferred.&#x0a;

        (5) Point of care lactate reading greater than or equal to 4 mmol/L (if available)&#x0a;
    d) Patients with hypotension or altered mental status should be considered to have septic shock and treated and transported rapidly. Patients may be treated under this protocol if they do not meet the above criteria with medical consultation.&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] IF PATIENT MEETS ABOVE SEPSIS CRITERIA, THIS PATIENT IS A PRIORITY 1 OR 2 PATIENT AND REQUIRES NOTIFICATION OF THE NEAREST APPROPRIATE FACILITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO ALLOW FOR HOSPITAL PREPARATION. DURING THE CONSULTATION WITH THE RECEIVING FACILITY, THE PROVIDER SHALL USE THE VERBIAGE, “SEPSIS ALERT” AS THE UNIVERSAL METHOD OF NOTIFYING THE FACILITY THAT THE PATIENT MEETS THE SEPSIS INCLUSION CRITERIA&#x0a;&#x0a;
3. Treatment&#x0a;&#x0a;
    a) Place patient in position of comfort, or supine if hypotension is present.&#x0a;
    b) Carefully monitor airway and respiratory status, manage as required using the appropriate respiratory distress protocol (especially for patients with suspected pneumonia).&#x0a;
    c) Initiate large bore IV. If large bore IV not available, consider a second peripheral IV with the intention of not causing delay in transport and reserve the use of IO for priority 1 patient. If transport time is greater than 20 minutes and IV access is unsuccessful, consider placement of an IO (especially for septic shock). Consider performing a blood draw if time permits. Accurately document start time of IV fluid initiation.&#x0a;
    d) If lungs are clear, and patient does not have a history of CHF or end stage renal failure, provide 2 L of LR wide open. Reassess every 500 mL for shortness of breath, blood pressure, and SpO2 saturation changes. OR&#x0a;
    e) If patient is fluid sensitive (i.e., has a history CHF, pulmonary edema, or end stage renal disease) infuse 250 mL and carefully monitor and reassess. Repeat 250 mL once if no worsening of respiratory status is noted to a max of 500 mL (consultation may be obtained to provide more fluid).&#x0a;
    f) If available, perform point of care lactate testing (Jurisdictional Pilot Program only).&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] FLUID LIMITS OR DOSES MAY BE MODIFIED WITH CONSULTATION.&#x0a;&#x0a;
    g) Place patient on cardiac monitor and perform 12-lead (do not delay IV therapy or fluid bolus).&#x0a;
    h) If hypotension persists after 2 L of LR are provided, consider an additional 2 L of LR (up to a maximum of 30 mL/kg total, including the first 2 L bolus) and/or dopamine 2–20 mcg/kg/min (paramedic only). Titrate to a Mean Arterial Pressure of 65 mmHg or systolic BP of 90 mmHg.&#x0a;

    a) Infection can cause a systemic response resulting in fever, altered mental status, shock including or excluding hypotension, and death. Early recognition and treatment with aggressive fluids, when not contraindicated, and early hospital notification may improve survival rates and patient outcomes.&#x0a;
    b) The pediatric septic patient may be difficult to identify due to a poor history or providers may have difficulty identifying an obvious source of infection, as many pediatric sepsis patients are very young children or infants.&#x0a;
    c) The following pediatric patients are at greater risk for sepsis and should have their temperature measured:&#x0a;
        (1) Altered mental status&#x0a;
        (2) Asplenia (spleen removed from treatment of trauma or illness)&#x0a;
        (3) Bone marrow or solid organ transplant&#x0a;

2. Presentation&#x0a;&#x0a;
    a) The primary objectives in burn care by EMS providers are to stop the burning process, establish IV access, avoid hypothermia, and transport patients quickly and safely to a burn center. While patients with large burns (greater than 20%), facial burns, and/or significant smoke inhalation often require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation during their resuscitation and care, airway compromise in the first few hours following a burn is uncommon.&#x0a;
        (1) In adults, prehospital tracheal intubation following acute burns is generally unnecessary unless signs of respiratory failure are present (symptomatic airway obstruction, shock, altered mental status, hypoxemia while receiving supplemental oxygen, or dyspnea, etc.).&#x0a;
        (2) Pediatric airways are smaller than adult airways and require frequent and thorough assessment for signs of respiratory distress. Intubate if necessary.&#x0a;
    b) Burns are the body’s response to injuries to the skin, muscles, bone, nerves, and blood vessels caused by thermal, chemical, electrical, radiation, or light source. Patients may exhibit any of the following: reddening of the skin, deep and intense pain, blisters, mottled appearance, and/or charred black or brown areas with severe or no pain.&#x0a;
    c) Indications for Referral to a Burn Center&#x0a;
        (1) All third degree burns (full thickness)&#x0a;
        (2) Second degree burns (partial thickness) greater than 10% total body surface area&#x0a;
        (3) Burns of the face, hands, feet, major joints, genitalia, or perineum&#x0a;
        (4) Electrical burns, including lightning or contact with high voltage (greater than 120 volts)&#x0a;
        (5) Suspected inhalation injury of toxic smoke (Monitor the patients with suspected inhalation injury for delayed airway obstruction, respiratory distress, or oxygen desaturation as the patient may need emergent airway management.)&#x0a;
        (6) Circumferential burns involving the extremities or torso&#x0a;
        (7) Chemical burns should be transported to the closest appropriate hospital for decontamination prior to referral to a burn center&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] PATIENTS WITH BURNS AND TRAUMA SHOULD BE REFERRED TO THE NEAREST APPROPRIATE TRAUMA CENTER FOR INITIAL CARE.&#x0a;&#x0a;
CHILDREN WHO MEET BURN INCLUSIVE CRITERIA WHO HAVE NOT REACHED THEIR 15TH BIRTHDAY SHOULD BE TRANSPORTED TO A PEDIATRIC BURN CENTER.&#x0a;&#x0a;
IF PATIENT HAS EXPOSURE TO CARBON MONOXIDE/SMOKE INHALATION, REFER TO CARBON MONOXIDE/SMOKE INHALATION PROTOCOL.&#x0a;&#x0a;
3. Treatment&#x0a;&#x0a;
    a) Extract the patient from burning vehicles or buildings if safe to do so and move patient to a place of relative safety.&#x0a;
    b) Do what is necessary to stop the burning process. If water is used to extinguish the fire, remove wet clothing and dry the patient to prevent hypothermia.&#x0a;
    c) Administer oxygen in as high a concentration of oxygen as possible (note: pulse oximetry is not reliable in the presence of carbon monoxide or cyanide exposure).&#x0a;
    d) Determine percent of body surface area (BSA) burned and depth.&#x0a;
    e) Treat associated trauma.&#x0a;
    f) For burns greater than 10%, follow Hypothermia Protocol as well.&#x0a;
    g) Remove all rings, bracelets, and other jewelry.&#x0a;
    h) Cover wounds appropriately (with a clean sheet or Mylar blanket—sterile dressings no longer recommended).&#x0a;
    i) For chemical burns, brush off dry chemical, remove clothing, flush with water.&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] DO NOT GIVE ANYTHING BY MOUTH.&#x0a;&#x0a;

    e) Consider AED if arrest is believed to be medical in nature and the patient meets the criteria.&#x0a;
    f) Treat reversible causes of traumatic arrest.&#x0a;
        (1) Open airway and ensure adequate ventilation, insert necessary adjunct; consider the need for advanced airway earlier in the resuscitation of the trauma arrest patient.&#x0a;
        (2) Seal open chest wounds with occlusive dressings.&#x0a;
        (3) Control life-threatening external hemorrhage.&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] PENETRATING TRAUMA PATIENTS HAVE AN IMPROVED CHANCE OF SURVIVAL WITH THE IMMEDIATE APPLICATION OF HEMORRHAGE CONTROL AND ALS BILATERAL NEEDLE DECOMPRESSIONS WHILE PREPARING AND LOADING THE PATIENT FOR IMMEDIATE TRANSPORT. IF THE PENETRATING TRAUMA PATIENT IS FOUND IN A RHYTHM OTHER THAN ASYSTOLE, AND THE TRAUMA CENTER IS WITHIN 15 MINUTES, COMPLETE THE TREATMENTS FOR REVERSIBLE CONDITIONS AND TRANSPORT THE PATIENT. IF TRANSPORT TIME EXCEEDS 15 MINUTES, GO TO LOCAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR FREESTANDING EMERGENCY MEDICAL FACILITY. BLUNT TRAUMA ARREST SHOULD HAVE ALL THE REVERSIBLE CAUSES OF ARREST PERFORMED ON SCENE BEFORE TERMINATION OF RESUSCITATION OR TRANSPORT IF ROSC IS ACHIEVED.&#x0a;&#x0a;
    g) Establish IV/IO access with LR. Begin rapid administration of 20 mL/kg bolus of LR IV/IO.&#x0a;
    h) Treat reversible causes of traumatic arrest.&#x0a;
        (1) Open airway and ensure adequate ventilation, insert necessary adjunct; consider the need for advanced airway earlier in the resuscitation of the trauma arrest patient.&#x0a;
        (2) Seal open chest wounds with occlusive dressings.&#x0a;
        (3) Control life-threatening external hemorrhage.&#x0a;
    (4) Bilateral Needle Decompression Thoracostomy. Catheters should not be removed once placed.&#x0a;
    (5) Establish IV/IO access with LR. Begin rapid administration of 20 mL/kg bolus of LR IV/IO.&#x0a;
    (6) Identify rhythm and refer to appropriate algorithm.&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] EPINEPHRINE IS CONTRAINDICATED IN THE TREATMENT OF TRAUMATIC CARDIAC ARREST FOR ADULT PATIENTS.&#x0a;&#x0a;

    i) Rapid assessment and extrication&#x0a;
    j) Perform spinal immobilization for blunt trauma patients only. Patients with isolated penetrating trauma should not have spinal immobilization performed. If mechanism includes both blunt and penetrating trauma, perform spinal immobilization.&#x0a;
    k) CPR&#x0a;
    l) Consider AED if arrest is believed to be medical in nature. (See Section IV, AED.)&#x0a;&#x0a;
[ALERT] A PATIENT IN CARDIOPULMONARY ARREST SECONDARY TO TRAUMA SHOULD BE TAKEN TO THE NEAREST APPROPRIATE PEDIATRIC TRAUMA CENTER. CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO TRANSPORTING THE PATIENT TO THE NEAREST EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR ADULT TRAUMA CENTER IF THE PEDIATRIC TRAUMA CENTER IS MORE THAN 10 MINUTES ADDITIONAL TRANSPORT TIME!&#x0a;&#x0a;
    m) Establish IV/IO access with LR.&#x0a;
    n) If age-related vital signs and patient’s condition indicate hypoperfusion, administer initial fluid bolus of 20 mL/kg LR IV/IO. If patient’s condition does not improve, administer the second bolus of fluid at 20 mL/kg LR IV/IO.&#x0a;
    o) If traumatic arrest is suspected due to multi-system blunt trauma, or due to penetrating neck, chest, or abdominal trauma, bilateral needle decompressions should be performed. Once manufacture assembled pneumothorax kit catheters are placed, do not remove.&#x0a;
